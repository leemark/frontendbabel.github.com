                Developing Cross-Browser Extensions

        <p class="text__p">What do we do if we have to search for something? Of course, we fire up our favorite search engine web site. It is quite hard to push yourself to use another a different search engine rather than the usual one, even if you know that the result would be better. To change this UX pattern I developed <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/likeastore/einhadilfmpdfmmjnnppomcccmlohjad">Likeastore Chrome
Extension</a>. It adds social
part to your search flow by showing relevant information from the article you liked. Besides Chrome we support Firefox
and Safari. Despite the platform difference all these extentions are built from the same codebase.</p>

        <p class="text__p">Let me introduce myself. I am an <em>Interface Designer</em> at Yandex, and I&#39;ve been involved with projects like Yandex.Maps
and Search Engine Results Page, and also designed brand icons, promo materials, documentation, a project planner, a
shared interface component library, and a fast prototyping system. Besides that, I follow my colleagues&#39; projects such
as Yandex Main Page and other Yandex portal services: Market, News, Images, Video, Disk, Auto, Realty. I see how these
projects grow and evolve.</p>

                What Every Frontend Developer Should Know About Webpage Rendering

        </a>
        
        <p class="text__p">Today I&#39;d like to focus on the subject of web page rendering and why it is important in web development. A lot of articles are available covering the subject, but the information is scattered and somehow fragmented. To wrap my head around the subject, for example, I had to study a lot of sources. That&#39;s why I decided I should write this article. I believe the article will be useful for beginners as well as for more advanced developers who want to refresh and structure what they already know.</p>
